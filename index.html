	<h1>About The Company</h1>
	<div id="about">
<p>Lexignton Goods Co. is a company that specializes in goods to improve the home. The company is founded by Mandela and Timothy Cocores a wife and husband duo. Timothy and Mandela have travelled to different cities and countries buying local ingridents and goods to formulate recipes to create their products. Some of the locations that these influences come from are San Francisco, Brooklyn, Saint Louis, Paris, Roma, the small town in Central Mexico; Aguacalientes and finally Portland, Oregon. By developing recipes from these different locations we were able to create a unique and delicious bloody mary and pickle brine that you will love and enjoy.

<h1>Our Values...</h1>
<div id="our">
<p>Here at Lexington Goods Co., we have strong values. We believe that a products should be made with love, instead of being mass produced on an assembly line. Each of our products are made small batch with locally sourced ingridents. We use experimental techniques on our products, which each product is tried and tasted by the employees at the company before it leaves our kitchen. We take pride in a product with the belief if we would not consume it then why should you?

<h1>Why Lexington Goods Co.?</h1>
<div id="why">
<p>We chose the name Lexington Goods Co. based off of our old street we lived on in San Francisco. We started out as a dry goods company but decided we should branch out to cover everything that we love. We love our dry goods equally as much as we love the places we have visited to create these. So go ahead and treat yourself, live a little!</p>
